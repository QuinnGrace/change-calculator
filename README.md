### Credits
A lot of the information about using OpenCV came from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&t=144s) FreeCodeCamp video on Youtube and [this](https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course) GitHub repository from jasmcaus.
I learnt how to resize images from [here](https://www.tutorialkart.com/opencv/python/opencv-python-resize-image/)
